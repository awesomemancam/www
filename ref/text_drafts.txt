Hi, my name is Camden Wagner and I am an 18 year old freshman (Class of 2019) at Connecticut College.  I am majoring in Computer Science with studies also in the Business and Economics fields.  I have significant coding experience in languages including Java, C, C++, HTML, PHP, CSS, Python, XML and more - several of my projects are detailed below.  Chess is my favorite hobby, I have played in many tournaments (also detailed below), run and participate in many chess clubs, and play online daily.  Other than that, I enjoy playing soccer and running as much as I can.
