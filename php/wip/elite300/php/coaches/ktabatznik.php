					<p>In 1994, Keith was named the South Atlantic Region and BIG EAST Coach of the Year after leading the Hoyas to an incredible 18-4 record and the school's first-ever berth in the NCAA Championship as well as its first BIG EAST Regular Season Title. Thirteen former Hoyas have become professional players.</p><p>In addition to taking Hoya soccer to new heights, Keith has been an integral part of the U.S. youth development programs. In 2004 he was appointed as the Director of the Maryland Olympic Development program - a position he had held previously from 1989 to 1997. In two years Maryland became one of the elite ODP programs in the nation again - winning 1 National Championship as well as 3 regional championships and placing 34 players into the regional pools. Keith also served three years as the U.S. National Amateur Team Head Coach and in 1997 was selected as the Region I and National Coach of the Year. In 1997, as head coach for the East Team in the U.S. Soccer Festival, Tabatznik led the East to the Gold Medal. Keith has also recently been appointed as the Assistant Coach for the Region 1 Olympic Development Program. He will be working under Head Coach Jay Hoffman and help oversee the 5 regional age groups and their staff.</p><p>Since leaving Georgetown in February of '06, Keith has been using his expertise to evaluate individual players, teams and programs. Last summer he spent time with the Swarthmore College Men's program during their preseason writing a thorough evaluation for the coach of every aspect of his program - including use of time and staff, effectiveness of training sessions as well as opinions on the team itself. Keith's 22 years as Head Coach at Georgetown University has made him one the absolute experts on everything to do with the college selection process. He lectures on the "College Recruiting Process" as well as doing various coaching and team clinics that are structured to the individual needs of the team and organization. (See Clinics/Consulting link above)</p><p>Keith holds a USSF "A" Coaching License and is currently a staff instructor for US Soccer state license and National "C" license courses. He is also is an analyst on Fox Soccer Channel for college games of the week as well as a guest commentator for Comcast sports and DC United pre and post game shows.</p>
